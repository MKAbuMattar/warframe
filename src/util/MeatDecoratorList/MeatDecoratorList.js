Companions are not a one-time-use ally gear like Specters but rather equipped in their own slot in the user's loadout via the arsenal. Users can only equip one companion at any time. A companion's stats, abilities, and behaviors can be upgraded and manipulated via their own set of mods. Modding companions are similar to modding Warframes. There are currently four classes of companions: robotic Sentinels, living Kubrows and Kavats, and the modular MOA. There are many differences between these classes ranging from combat and movement behaviors to acquisition to possible maintenance requirements.",
